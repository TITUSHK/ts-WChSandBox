StudyCoveragesTim.C simulate TITUS or ANNIE with different configurations of photosensors with or without LAPPDs.

StudyCoveragesMRD.C plot the energy spectrum of muons that reach MRD and the energy spectrum of neutrinos which create muons that reach MRD

StudyCoveragesMRD2.C plot the energy spectrum of muons that reach MRD for each mode and for each configuration. It create a new canvas for each configuration.

StudyCoverages_ncaptNu.C plot the number of photons reaching photosensors for a single Gd-captured neutron and the number of neutrons captured for each mode for the nu files.

StudyCoverages_ncaptAntinu.C plot the number of photons reaching photosensors for a single Gd-captured neutron and the number of neutrons captured for each mode for the antinu files.

StudyCoverages_ncaptAntinu_eachConfigTITUS.C plot the number of photons reaching photosensors for a single Gd-captured for each configuration in the same plot for antinu files and TITUS detector.

StudyCoverages_ncaptAntinu_eachConfigANNIE.C plot the number of photons reaching photosensors for a single Gd-captured for each configuration in the same plot for antinu files and ANNIE detector.

StudyCoverages_ncaptPMTs_eachConfigTITUS.C plot the number of PMTs hitted by photons, the number of photons by PMT and the maximum number of photons hitting one PMT. To use this without error you need to use the SandBoxPMTcoverage.cc which is here (only the value of PSnum is changed).
